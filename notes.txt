Next steps?

Maybe make an .exe and make sure that works?

3/9/16

Problem: py2exe doesn't support python 3.5, and doesn't look like it will anyone soon.

I could install python 2.7.11, and try that?

I'll have to blow away my current versionify virtualenv, and then recreate it using python 2.7.11, and
then re pip install py2exe, but that shouldn't be so bad..

LATER THAT DAY:

Okay, so that worked; the exe file when a file is drag-and-dropped onto it creates a backup as it should.

But a shortcut to the exe doesn't work. Now getting SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing for file "<string>", line 0...

It works!

I done figured it out!

Now I have to figure out how to write an installer....
